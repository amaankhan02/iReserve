## Project Summary

Our project is a room reserver web application that allows users to book study rooms around campus. This app allows users to view the availability of study rooms around them and place reservations on study rooms if they wish to use them in the future. The application will also allow users to search for a room in any area of campus they wish and receive. Our application will also allow users to block off a room if they are in the vicinity and the room is available.
